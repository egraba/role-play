      sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored

      an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the
      contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it. The hand can't attack,

      This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the
      following magical effects within range: You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a
      shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor. You instantaneously light or snuff
      out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire. You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1
      cubic foot. You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour. You make a
      color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour. You create a nonmagical
      trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.
      If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active
      at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

      this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending

      a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical
