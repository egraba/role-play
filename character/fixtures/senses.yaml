      Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious,
      for 4 hours a day.
      (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”)
      While meditating, you can dream after a fashion;
      such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.
      After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.
