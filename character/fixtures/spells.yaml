      You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object
      sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored
      as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you
      cast it again or dismiss it as an action. If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that
      creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.

      until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if
      you cast this spell again. You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate
      an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the
      contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it. The hand can't attack,
      activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

      This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the
      following magical effects within range: You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a
      shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor. You instantaneously light or snuff
      out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire. You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1
      cubic foot. You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour. You make a
      color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour. You create a nonmagical
      trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.
      If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active
      at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

      This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures
      this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending
      order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures). Starting with the creature that has the
      lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the
      sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature's
      hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit
      points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected. Undead and creatures
      immune to being charmed aren't affected by this spell.
